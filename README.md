# Why
Recently, I have been following the [Hyperledger][1] project and [Fabric][4] in particular with fair bit of interest.  The current deployment process[^1] for [Fabric Starter Kit][6] uses [Docker Swarm][2].  

[Kubernetes][5] is a leading platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of containerised applications.  It is comparable to [Docker Swarm][2] in terms of target use cases.

Using [Kubernetes][5] would allow [Fabric][4] to leverage features like:
1. Automatic binpacking
2. Horizonta scaling
3. Automated rollouts and rollbacks
4. Storage orchestration
5. Self-healing
6. Service discovery and load balancing
7. Secret and configuration management
8. Batch execution

So this article looks at a simple way to deploy [Fabric Starter Kit][6] on a [Kubernetes][5] platform.  This would be the first step in getting a _production-grade_ [Fabric][4] deployment on [Kubernetes][5].

With developer as the primary audience, we will use [OpenShift][7] as the underlying platform; as [Kubernetes][5] comes bundled in with [OpenShift][7].

# What 
[Fabric][4] application is composed of functional components distributed as linux containers using [Docker][3] packaging format.  

[Kubernetes][5] is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure.

[OpenShift Container Platform - OCP][7] is based on top of [Docker][3] containers and the [Kubernetes][5] container cluster manager.  [OCP][7] adds developer and operational management centric tools to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams and applications. 

# How
## Environment
I am using <kbd>macOS Sierra</kbd> for development, with following configuration:
* Mac OSX native [Docker version 1.12.1][9]
* Client tools [version 1.3.1][10] for OpenShift Container Platform

## Steps to deploy [fabric-starter-kit][6] on OpenShift/Kubernetes
1. Bring up OpenShift service
    ```bash
    oc cluster up
    ```
    > First time you execute this command it will take sometime as the service might download required OpenShift images
    
    Note the information within **--Server Information** section  
    >-- Server Information ...   
    OpenShift server started.  
   The server is accessible via web console at:  
       https://192.168.0.7:8443

   >You are logged in as:
       User:     developer
       Password: developer

   >To login as administrator:
       oc login -u system:admin

2. Allow the application to run as <kbd>root</kbd> or within a *privileged* container.
> Allowing application containers to run as <kbd>root</kbd> *by default* should be strongly discouraged[^2]  

   1. Login as an administrator
   ```bash
   oc login -u system:admin
   ```
   2. Allow the *default* user to run applications in a privileged mode (or in [OpenShift][7] speak, within a [privileged security context constraints][8])[^3]
   ```bash
   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n myproject
   ```
   3. Logout as administrator and log back in as the default user
   ```bash
   oc login -u developer
   ```
3. Download the docker-compose file for the starter-kit
   ```bash
   wget -O docker-compose-fabric-starter-kit.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/examples/sdk/node/docker-compose.yml
   ```
4. Update the downloaded YAML file to ensure appropriate ports are *exposed*[^4].

   ```YAML
   # updated snippet of docker-compose-fabric-starter-kit.yml
   membersrvc:
     ports:
     - "7054:7054"

   peer:
     ports:
     - "7051:7051"
   ```
5. Import the docker-compose application into OpenShift
   ```bash
   oc import docker-compose -f docker-compose-fabric-starter-kit.yml
   ```
6. Allow _member service_ to be executed with _root_ status
   ```bash
   oc patch dc membersrvc -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"membersrvc","securityContext":{"privileged":true}}]}}}}'
   ```
7. Allow validating peer service _vp0_ to be executed with _root_ status
   ```bash
   oc patch dc vp0 -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"vp0","securityContext":{"privileged":true}}]}}}}'
   ```
8. Give the system couple of minutes to startup the required containers.  Then ensure that all the services are up and running.
   ```bash
   oc get pods
   ```
   >Result should be similar to below:  
   
   ```bash
   NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
   membersrvc-2-3ft1y   1/1       Running   0          16m  
   peer-2-3p43z         1/1       Running   0          15m  
   starter-1-h8z1d      1/1       Running   1          16m  
   ```
   
   1. <kbd>membersrvc-2-3ft1y</kbd> is the member service
   2. <kbd>peer-2-3p43z</kbd> is the validating peer service
   3. <kbd>starter-1-h8z1d</kbd> is the fabric-starter-kit service
   
9. Deploy and execute the sample *chaincode[^5]* using Node.js Client SDK within the fabric-starter-kit
   ```bash
   oc exec starter-1-h8z1d node app
   ```
   >Result should be similar to below:  
   ```bash
   *** starting HFC sample ***
   member services address =membersrvc:7054
   peer address =peer:7051
   DEPLOY_MODE=dev
   enrolling user admin ...
   Enrolled JohnDoe successfully
   deploying chaincode; please wait ...
   deploy complete; results: {"uuid":"mycc","chaincodeID":"mycc"}
   invoke chaincode ...
   invoke submitted successfully; results={"uuid":"85782c59-e192-499f-8a5d-108c4423133d"}
   invoke completed successfully; results={"result":"Tx 85782c59-e192-499f-8a5d-108c4423133d complete"}
   querying chaincode ...
   query completed successfully; results={"result":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,55]}}
   ```
10. Investigate logs for the peer validating service
    ```bash
    oc logs peer-2-3p43z
    ```
    > Result should be similar to:  
    ```bash

    ```

This proves how easy it is to start developing _chaincode applications[^4]_ to run on [Fabric][4] network.

# Next steps
- [ ] Use the fabric-starter-kit and run it as a standalone app in an external OpenShift project
- [ ] Get the *peer* and *member* services to run with non-root privilege
